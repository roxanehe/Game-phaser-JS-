# spaceship-game
1.a start page of showing spaceships moving, and also 1 buttons with 'start',which will take users to a new page
   --done, but I am not satisfied with the assets as I wanna better looks of the button & cursor,I also tried to add a music to this page but it is not working well so I commented out
2. 1 will take users to a page with storyline dialogues and a different background( spaceship inside),content in the dialogue have a type-writer effect and users can pressed enter to access the next one.
eg.

3. 2 will take users to the last page of users interacting with plants & creatures in a planet seeting, users can hit a enemy, can exploit plants/other resources,and they can move around etc
  --functionality wise are basic like what ve done, but I need to use other assets, and fixed bugs such as the player avatar can't automatically change diirections when they move
